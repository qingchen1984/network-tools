# network-tools
tools to measure network throughput and latency

## flooz
flooz is a tiny, fast, traffic generator for Linux. Flooz uses AF_XDP to achieve maximum performances

## weed
weed is an end-to-end delay calculator. It sends packets to an interface, and measures how much time elapses until the packet can be received on another interface

## shtraf
shtraf is a shell script which shows tx and rx throughput and packets per seconds which are flowing through an interface

## utraf
like shtraf, but written in C and more precise ;)
